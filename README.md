# Background

This document is a pipeline underlining the development of an african NLP developed by Africans on Botswana's languages and cultural view .Yes, there are Setswana models out there, but in Botswana we have a different ethicity and various dialects that are not  included in any if not captured to its true nature.

# Analysis

As one of the findings that there is less labeled training data on the internet for Setswana, sekalaka, seyeyi, sehambukushi, and sekhalagari, with the most concerning been the khoi-san. Bantu and Khoi San are far from being the same which mean there is a larger gap between the languages in terms of specificity.

# Recommendations

As Kitso Ai we are determined to find a pipeline for an NLP that can do well under this various languages with different coodination eg other falling under Niger Congo B (bantu) and the khoi-san having their own complex coordination of wording and delects this will if not led to us trying to build an infrastructure that accomodates the khoi San given afrikans has khoi origin so will led to less bumpy road map even those the san also in botswana have a deferent dilect if not same to the ones in South africa.

# Implementation

create a pipeline ,connect with the community , tag data(label data) create a comprehense dataset train a pre existing model fail and re iterate now wit a clear roadmap
