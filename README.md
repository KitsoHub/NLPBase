# 🌍 NLPBase: NLP for African Languages – Rooted in Botswana

> *By Africans, for Africa — building natural language technologies that reflect our diversity, dialects, and heritage.*

## 📌 Background

This repository outlines a comprehensive NLP pipeline dedicated to advancing Natural Language Processing for African languages, with a primary focus on Botswana’s linguistic landscape. While models for languages like Setswana exist, they often fail to capture the **regional specificity, dialectal variation, and cultural context** unique to Botswana.

We recognize that:
- Setswana in Botswana differs in **ethicity, pronunciation, vocabulary, and usage** from its South African counterpart.
- Minority languages such as **Sekalanga, Seyeyi, Sehambukushi, Sekhalagari**, and especially **Khoi-San languages** are severely underrepresented in digital and AI spaces.
- Bantu and Khoi-San languages belong to entirely different linguistic families — Niger-Congo (Bantu) vs. Khoe-Kwadi, Tuu, and Kx'a — with distinct grammatical structures, phonology (including clicks), and semantics.

This project aims to build **inclusive, community-driven NLP tools** that honor Botswana’s full linguistic diversity — not just the majority language.

## 🔍 Analysis & Motivation

A major challenge in developing NLP for Botswana’s languages is the **lack of labeled training data**. Key issues include:

- **Sparse digital presence**: Limited text corpora for most local languages.
- **Dialectal fragmentation**: Regional variations are often ignored in existing datasets.
- **Marginalization of Khoi-San languages**: Despite their deep historical roots in Southern Africa, these languages are rarely included in AI initiatives — even though African linguistic heritage is incomplete without them.

> 📚 **Insight from Research**:  
> As highlighted in *Hilde Gunnink's* study ["Language contact between Khoisan and Bantu languages: The case of Setswana"](https://doi.org/10.2989/16073614.2020.1737158), Setswana has undergone subtle but significant contact-induced changes due to interaction with Khoisan speakers — including loanwords and semantic shifts. This underscores the **interconnectedness** of these communities and the need for inclusive NLP infrastructure.

Ignoring Khoi-San linguistic complexity risks perpetuating a **one-size-fits-all model** that fails both historically and technically.

## 🎯 Vision & Recommendation

At **Kitso AI**, we believe the future of African NLP must be:
- **Decolonized**: Built by Africans, grounded in local knowledge.
- **Inclusive**: Designed to include both dominant and endangered languages.
- **Sustainable**: Developed with long-term community engagement.

### ✅ Our Recommendation:
Build an NLP pipeline that **explicitly accommodates Khoi-San languages**, recognizing:
- Their unique phonological systems (e.g., click consonants).
- Complex morphosyntax and word formation patterns.
- Distinct dialects across regions (e.g., San communities in Botswana vs. South Africa).

By centering Khoi-San languages from the start, we create a **smoother, more equitable roadmap** for all African language technologies — honoring the fact that **many Africans trace ancestral roots to the Khoi and San peoples**.

## 🛠️ Implementation Strategy

We follow an iterative, community-centered pipeline:

1. **Design a Custom NLP Pipeline**
   - Based on best practices (see [NLP Pipeline Guide](https://medium.com/@asjad_ali/understanding-the-nlp-pipeline-a-comprehensive-guide-828b2b3cd4e2)).
   - Adapted for low-resource, multilingual African contexts.

2. **Engage Local Communities**
   - Collaborate with native speakers, elders, educators, and linguists.
   - Collect authentic speech, writing, and oral traditions ethically.

3. **Data Collection & Labeling (Annotation)**
   - Create high-quality, labeled datasets for Setswana and minority languages.
   - Prioritize semantic richness, dialectal variation, and pragmatic use.

4. **Build Comprehensive Corpora**
   - Combine existing resources with newly collected data.
   - Ensure open access and ethical licensing.

5. **Train & Evaluate Models**
   - Start with fine-tuning pre-trained models.
   - Fail fast, learn faster — iterate based on real-world feedback.

6. **Deploy, Monitor, and Update**
   - Integrate models into real applications (e.g., education, health, government).
   - Continuously monitor performance and adapt to linguistic drift.
